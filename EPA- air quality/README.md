We are assigned to analyze data on air quality with respect to carbon monoxide, a major air pollutant. The data includes information from more than 200 sites, identified by state, county, city, and local site names. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is the Environmental Protection Agency's index for reporting air quality. The United States is considering a new federal policy that would create a subsidy for renewable energy in states observing an average AQI of 10 or above.
We are asked to identify which of these states are most likely to be affected, should the new federal policy be enacted.

They also asked:

- considering a metropolitan-focused approach. Within California, they want to know if the mean AQI in Los Angeles County is statistically different from the rest of California.
- With limited resources, ROA has to choose between New York and Ohio for their next regional office. Does New York have a lower AQI than Ohio?
- A new policy will affect those states with a mean AQI of 10 or greater. Would Michigan be affected by this new policy?

  We took a sample from our data, then used Central Limit Theorem to identify the sample mean. After that we used three hypothesis t tests for each task.
  The first two test were rejected, while we fail to reject the last one.
