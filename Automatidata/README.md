For this dataset: 
- We organized the data for the process of exploratory data analysis.
- We cleaned, joined, validated, and created a visualization for the taxi commission data.
- We figured out the relationship between payment type and the fare amount the customer pays by A/B test. The result was that there was a statistically significant difference in the average fare amount between customers who used credit cards and customers who used cash. The business insight was that encouraging customers to pay with credit cards can generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
- We developed a multiple regression model.
- And lastly, the result from random forest model, was more accurate than XGboost model.
