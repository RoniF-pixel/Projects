They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 
Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles.We are asked to build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.

- The goal of this project was to create a multiple linear regression and random forest model to predict high rider gratuity or not. This project utilized yellow taxi trips taken in New York City during 2017. The final random forest model performed with 68% accuracy and 67% precision determining what features were most important in separating low tippers from high tippers. 
from this dataset: 
- According to salary.com the average salary for a New York Taxi Driver is around $45,000. This salary is significantly low compared to a median rent value of $6,500 per month. It is important to understand what factors encourage riders to leave tips in order to help drivers obtain a livable wage.
- The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission data came from NYC.gov. The data consisted of approximately 22k unique trips and 18 features. The features included information on trip duration and destination, vendor used, toll information, and payment type. The bar chart below shows the breakdown of how many generous tippers (>20%) versus non-generous tippers that exist in the data set.

- Features were engineered to represent tip percent, generous tippers and if a ride was taken during rush hour or not. Multiple redundant columns were dropped and reformatted into the proper data type.
- A random forest model comprising 300 decision trees was used to determine feature importance in who would tip generously or not. The below plot shows that VendorID, predicted_fare, mean_duration, and mean_distance are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that VendorID is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. The overall model performed with 68% accuracy and 67% precision.

- This model can benefit Taxi Drivers in knowing if they will be tipped generously or not; however, running a parametric model will help to determine how much each variable will influence the actual price of the tip. In the future, adding more information on a rider’s past tipping behavior may also be beneficial in helping the stakeholder address their business problem.
