The data for this activity is for a sample size of 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others.
We wanted a model that predicts whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience.

The success of the model suggests that the airline should invest more in model developement to examine if adding more independent variables leads to better results. Building this model could not only be useful in predicting whether or not a customer would be satisfied but also lead to a better understanding of what independent variables lead to happier customers.
