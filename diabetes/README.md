The data was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

We used different pandas and numpy methods to understand the dataset, explore its columns, and gain insights into the relationships between different features. Then, we cleaned and prepared the data for our classification model. Our classification model was built using the Logistic Regression.
