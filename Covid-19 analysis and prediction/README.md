This is the Covid-19 dataset analyzed by me.

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that, given a Covid-19 patient's current symptom, status, and medical history, will predict whether the patient is at high risk or not. Found missing data, handled outliers, did EDA and a lot of visualizations to answer specific questions and do comparisons among different variables. Finally did try different models and picked the best model that could accurately predict the project.

Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
