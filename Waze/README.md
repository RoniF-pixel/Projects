Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. We help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. If Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, it can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may lose these users without knowing why. 

- The goal of this project was to develop a churn prediction model that helps prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. The final XGBoost model performed with 81% accuracy and 42% precision determining what features were most important in separating retained users from churned users. This model fit the data even better than the random forest model. The recall score is 17% which is nearly double the recall score from the logistic regression model, and it's almost 50% better than the random forest model's recall score, while maintaining a similar accuracy and precision score.
- The data consisted of approximately 15k unique trips and 13 features. The features included information on label(churned or retained), session(# of opening the app), type of device(Android, iPhone), n_days_after_onboarding, total_navigations_fav1, total_navigations_fav2 (fav=favorite place), driven_km_drives(Total km driven during the month), duration_minutes_drives, activity_days, and driving_days(at least 1 km).

- We found out that the users who churned drove farther and longer in fewer days than retained users. They also used the app about half as many times as retained users over the same period.
- Less than 18% of users churned, and ~82% were retained.
- We engineered features to see their impact on churning called kilometers per driving day, percent_sessions_in_last_month that represents the percentage of each user's total sessions that were logged in their last month of use, total_sessions_per_day, km_per_hour, km_per_drive, and percent_of_sessions_to_favorite. Then a new, binary feature called professional_driver that separates professional drivers from other driversThe churn rate for professional drivers is 7.6%, while the churn rate for non-professionals is 19.9%.
- The XGBoost model fit the data better than the random forest model. The recall score is nearly double the recall score from the logistic regression model, and it's almost 50% better than the random forest model's recall score, while maintaining a similar accuracy and precision score.
- The model predicted three times as many false negatives than it did false positives, and it correctly identified only 16.6% of the users who actually churned.

- If the model is used to drive consequential business decisions, it is not a strong enough predictor, as made clear by its poor recall score. However, if the model is only being used to guide further exploratory efforts, then it can have value.
- New features could be engineered to try to generate better predictive signal, as they often do if we have domain knowledge. In the case of this model, the engineered features made up over half of the top 10 most-predictive features used by the model. It could also be helpful to reconstruct the model with different combinations of predictor variables to reduce noise from unpredictive features.
